We, at [School of Devops](https://schoolofdevops.com) take pride to introduce you to Craftista, a Polyglot, Micro-Services based application, built with the Modern Tech stack, specially designed to be used as a learning app to buid Devops Projects with.  


## Project Builder's Repo 

 If you want to learn by building projects, head over to [Craftista Builder's Project](https://github.com/craftista/craftista) instead and start from scratch. 



## Launching the App 

```
git clone https://github.com/craftista/craftista-demo.git
cd craftista-demo
docker compose build 
docker compose up -d
[if there are port coflicts, update docker-compose.yaml and change the host ports (left hand side of port mapping) and then run the above command again]
```

Thats all, you should see the complete Craftista App running and available on http://IPADDRESS where replace IPADDRESS with the actul IP or Hostname (try http://localhost if you are not sure). 

Enjoy Playing with it !
